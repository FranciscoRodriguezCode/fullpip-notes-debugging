- Currently debugging dark mode for FullPiP Notes, will be updating on main fullpip-notes repository when I fix the manifest.js file for theme adaptation.

## 06/15/2025
- Testing bold and italic functions for the textbox

## 06/17/2025 
- Added button outline for theme selection modal
- Transforming <textarea> functions over to <div> with contenteditable = True
- Need to fix:
  1. Bullet Point functionality (adds phantom bullet after 2 Enters)
  2. Title and newline issue (immediately under new line instead of 1 more)
  3. Need to adapt format buttons to reflect area where the format is applied (currently works if is at end of line but button remains the same
